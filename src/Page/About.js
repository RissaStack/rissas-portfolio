      <p>Hello! My name is Larissa Stack. I go by Rissa. I am an inspiring front-end web developer. I just graduated the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Arizona University. While taking the course, I found that I love working on the front-end. What do I love about it? WELL... creating visually appealing designs and being creative are two of my favorite things to do. I want to help make applications more user friendly by applying styling that just makes sense!</p>

      <h3>What I Do Today</h3>
      <p>I am currently a middle school teacher. I have become a jack of all trades in teaching over the past 10 years. I have taught pre-K though 8th and many subjects including physical education, choir, theater, and computer technology. 2020 was my first fully certified year of teaching and I won Coconino's Teacher of the Year Abassador. I have coached volleyball, girl's basketball, and boy's basketball for my school. I also ran a video game club my first two years. While teaching I discovered that I had a passion for the technologies we used in the classroom and wanted to be a part of that world! I can't wait to begin that journey!</p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>My Personal Life</h3>
      <p>I live in Flagstaff, Arizona. I have dogs, fish, and a cat. I love my pets like crazy! I also have a 7-year-old daughter who can make me laugh on the spot! I live with all of them and a great boyfriend who has helped support me to make this transition into the tech world. I am a high school girls JV basketball coach. Coaching is one of my greatest passions! I love watching the girls grow into better players and human beings. It is a great way I can give back to my community. I am also part of the Flagstaff Music Theater company. I help to put on musical performances with acting, singing, and set designs. My favorite production I have been a part of was 'Something Rotten'. I also love video games. I think they are a great way to work on problem solving sckills, communication, perseverance, teamwork, and many other life skills! </p>
